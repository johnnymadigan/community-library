# **About**
**Game of Life** is a famous zero-player, cellular automaton game. The entire game is a CLI app where users can configure custom settings to change how the app simulates 'life'. The project demonstrates my understanding of the Object-Oriented-Programming paradigm.

In a world where Blockbusters are going broke to extinction, the new Community Library app is set
to revive the business. Upon launching, users will be greeted with an eye-catching main menu. This
menu then branches off to staff and member sub-menus with their respective functions.
Staff can register and remove members, add and remove movies or copies of movies, display a memberâ€™s
contact, and all members renting a specific movie.
Once registered, members can log in with their full name and a PIN. Members can view information
on all movies or a specific movie, borrow and return DVDs, list movies they are currently borrowing,
and display the top 3 most popular movies.
The app was developed with efficiency in mind, using a range of analysed algorithms behind the
scenes to ensure speedy and smooth functionality.
